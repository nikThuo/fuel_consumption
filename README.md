# Fuel Consumption Prediction
This project is about vehicles city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon. It is a Supervised End to End Machine Learning project on Fuel Consumption Prediction for the 70s and 80s vehicles.

# Project Description
The problem statement is on a regression type of project on Fuel Consumption Prediction using different machine learning models:
    Linear Regression
    Decision Tree
    Random Forest
    SVM Regressor 

The dataset is on fuel consumption in miles per gallon from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The deployment is done on Heroku using Flask web framework.
